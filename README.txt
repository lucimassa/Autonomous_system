python version: python 3.8


To train the network is sufficient to run train.py, while to test test.py
the network has lready been trained, so the training should not be needed.
Anyway if a new training needs to be done, the easist way to do it is to modify the variable AGENT_NAME in utils.const.

The reults of the train (how the network improves over time) can be viualized by running the python file show_results.py.
