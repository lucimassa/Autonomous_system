python version: python 3.8


To train the network is sufficient to run train.py, while test.py to test it.
the network has already been trained, so the training should not be needed.
Anyway if a new training needs to be done, the easist way is to modify the variable AGENT_NAME in utils.const.

The reults of the train (how the network improves over time) can be viualized by running the python file show_results.py.
